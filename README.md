# Lung Cancer Detection Using MATLAB (2015b-Compatible)

This project implements a lung cancer detection system using image processing techniques in MATLAB. It analyzes CT scan images and classifies them as one of the following:

1. **Artery**  
2. **Malignant Lung Cancer**  
3. **Benign Lung Cancer**

The project is fully compatible with MATLAB 2015b and is ideal for students or researchers working on medical imaging or final-year projects.

## Features
- **Preprocessing**: Enhances image quality using resizing and noise removal techniques.  
- **Lung Segmentation**: Detects and isolates the lung region from the CT image.  
- **Feature Extraction**: Analyzes properties like area and intensity of segmented regions.  
- **Classification**: Uses extracted features to classify the image into one of three categories.  
- **Visualization**: Displays all steps (original image, preprocessing, segmentation, and classification) in a single window for better understanding.

## Requirements
- **MATLAB Version**: 2015b or newer.  
- **Toolboxes Required**:  
  - Image Processing Toolbox.
